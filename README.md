### Ninja Detective


The current situation of dispute handling between businesses and  the Ninjavan agents was through email and text, which was not very accessible and had a lack of transparency in regards to the businesses. They were unable to monitor the status of their issues and cases in real time. This proved to be a hassle for the businesses and paints ninjavanâ€™s customer service in a bad light.


This project was built to solve the topic of transparency and more importantly, bring convenience and allow the business to view their cases all in one portal.


This project was built on ReactJs framework for the front-end of application and Firebase Real time database as the storage for the back-end. The firebase solution is a temporary measure as the final integration should be done with the Dash and Salesforce application that Ninjavan currently uses and maintains.


##### Important Features:


* Tracks case status in real time.
* Offers notification when the case is resolved.
* Access past history of cases.


##### Additional future implementations:

* Live chat with agent
* Since Ninjavan is expanding into SouthEast Asia, the translation feature would help the businesses in terms of communication.
